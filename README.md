Skins Tracker

https://secret-coast-08930.herokuapp.com/

The purpose of this page is to allow friendly but competitive golfers a tool that will track their wins and losses.  Having a drink and 
arguing over who is the better golfer is a long tradition in the game.  Unfortunately, memories fade so their is never a definitive 
resolution to this argument of the ages.  Skins Tracker allows golfers to track their wins and losses against competitors to determine not
only their basic won/loss record but their betting results as well.  

# Technologies Used: #
  ## NodeJS / Javascript is used to create the web page and perform the logic necessary to present the information
  
  ## 7 Restful Routes/CRUD
  
  ## Express (initial package.json built with init, express, method-override, mongoose, ejs)
  
  ## Full MVC (Models, Views (EJS files), Controllers)
  
  ## HTML is used to create the basic structure of the page.
  
  ## CSS is used to style the web page.
  
  ## Mongoose DB
  
  ## Authorization - bcrypt, express-session session, dotenv
  
  ## EJS Partials
  
  # Challenges:  
  1.  I wasted a day and a half trying to make a datastructure work but I could not.  I learned that I need to review the data manipulation skills and revisit this task.  With only a few days to do the project and little room for error I could not spend the time I might have liked learning something new.  Disappointing but... thats the way it goes.
  2.  After I made the change to a strict record data structure the task was relatively straightforward.  I completed the meat of the task on day 3.  I learned during this that I do not have the grasp of imbedded functions that I would like to.
  3.  Even though it was a stretch goal and I didn't have a tremendous amount of confidence in my ability to be successful, I put password authorization in on Day 4.  During this task I did develop the proper understanding of the controllers and even separating routes from controllers but my understanding of that second aspect is still incomplete. After successfully implementing authorization I uploaded the application to Heroku at 11:00 pm pst where its execution was met with a resounding thud.  It absolutely ruined my sleep that night.  Because adding authorization was a later decision I did not have all the parameters loaded into Heroku necessary for the bcrypt part of authorization to work.  
  4. CSS - while I have had great success with my css in the classroom projects - my scrambled sleepy brain could not pull it together on 5.  I wanted to use an image and I just couldn't make it work across all pages the same way.  I punted and picked a soothing yellow color for a background and went to bed.

  
  ## Improvements:
  The design is not responsive because I coded it small to be a cell phone application.  Users will be arguing at a bar and it is not anticipated that they'll have a laptop or tablet.  They're going to be on their phones.  
  
  It would be best to pull the handicaps of the players from the pga website on the day so the wins/losses and betting are more accurate.  
    
I think it would also be an easy task to link to the pga website and the financial market overview channels.
